## Some Interesting Trivia About Constantine
 
Constantine is not only a thrilling and action-packed film, but also a film with many interesting trivia and behind-the-scenes facts. Here are some of them:

- The character of John Constantine was originally created by Alan Moore, during his run on DC Comics' "Swamp Thing". However, following his negative experience with From Hell (2001) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work. Thus, he gave all the money he would've gotten to the artist who drew the character with him, and rejected his own "created by" credit from the film.
- The look of Hell was based on old footage of nuclear tests, specifically the sudden shockwave immediately after the blast that disintegrated anything in its path, hence the crumbling landscape.
- The "Spear of Destiny" prop is the same one as used in Hellboy (2004). The films were scheduled to be released within a short space of time between them, and it was decided that having such similar titles would hurt the sales of tickets. Therefore Hellblazer was changed to Constantine.
- Keanu Reeves bought the Holy Shotgun prop, and gave it to director Francis Lawrence as a gift.
- According to an interview with The A.V. Club published on 28th August 2017, Peter Stormare came up with his own costume design for the appearance of Lucifer; the off-white linen suit with tar dripping down from his feet are specifically mentioned. The producer and director had initially wanted "leather trousers, bare-chested...a dog collar with spikes" and tattoos over Stormare's face and chest.
- When the possessed girl crawls on the ceiling early in the film she says, "Papatayin natin sila!" This is a Tagalog (Filipino) phrase meaning "We'll kill them all!"

These are just some of the trivia that make Constantine a fascinating film to watch. If you want to know more, you can check out the sources below or watch the film yourself.
